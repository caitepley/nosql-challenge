# nosql-challenge
The purpose of this assignment is to update and analyze restaurant data contained in a MongoDB database. The file called 'NoSQL_setup.ipynb' contains a Jupyter notebook that is used to update the contents of the database so that only useful information is left and it is in a form that is usable. The file called 'NoSQL_analysis.ipynb' contains an analysis of the restaurant data.

## To Run
Python needs to be installed in order to run the programs.

MongoDB needs to be running on your local machine. A database entitled 'uk_food' with a collection called 'establishments' should be created. The json file from Resources (establishments.json) in this repository needs to be imported into the 'establishments' collection before running the Jupyter notebooks.

The Jupyter notebooks can be ran cell-by-cell or as a whole to manipulate and analyze the data.
